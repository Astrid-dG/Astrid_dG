[Tuberculosis Rates around the World for the Last Two Decades](https://rpubs.com/AstridChristyne/1101876)
<img src="Projects/TBHIVrate/TBHIVLE.png?raw=true"/>

A project looking at changing Tuberculosis (TB) rates around the world with some drivers of change such as 
resistant strains and HIV. The incidence of TB has reduced over the last two decades, this
is also associated with changes in higher life expectancy and reduced HIV prevalence. However the further
emergence of resistant TB strains provides a challenge in tackling this global health problem going forward.

[Analysis of Share Growth for Russell 3000 Prior to the Pandemic](Projects/FinanceRussell3000index/DataModellingFinance.ipynb)

<img src="Projects/FinanceRussell3000index/AUC.png?raw=true"/>

The application of machine learning to forecast US stock performance for profitable investments prior to the pandemic is examined in this project using the 
Russell 3000 Index as it contains 98 percent of the US market that is open for investment. The Random Forest model with refined parameters would 
be the best fit for predicting high performing shares. It had good overall accuracy with a score of 0.87, but could have had 
better precision (0.76) as there were 7 false positives in the model. Its AUC was much higher than the other models, suggesting it is less prone to overfitting.

<img src="Projects/Streaming_ABtest/ABhrsWatched.png?raw=true"/> 

An analysis of AB testing of streaming company data, I worked around the limitations in data
and ensured the results were statistically significant. The data provided included control group data prior 
to AB test which was excluded to not bias the results as shown in the graph above. The intervention group 
increased their watch time by 30 minutes daily on average for the duration of the trial.
