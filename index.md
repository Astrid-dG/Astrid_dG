<img src="Projects/TBHIVrate/TBHIVLE.png?raw=true"/>

A project looking at changing Tuberculosis (TB) rates around the world with some drivers of change such as 
resistant strains and HIV. The incidence of TB has reduced over the last two decades, this
is also associated with changes in higher life expectancy and reduced HIV prevalence. However the further
emergence of resistant TB strains provides a challenge in tackling this global health problem going forward.

<img src="Projects/Streaming_ABtest/ABhrsWatched.png?raw=true"/> 

An analysis of AB testing of streaming company data, I worked around the limitations in data
and ensured the results were statistically significant. The data provided included control group data prior 
to AB test which was excluded to not bias the results as shown in the graph above. The intervention group 
increased their watch time by 30 minutes daily on average for the duration of the trial.
